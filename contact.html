                                <p><b>Name:</b> Chloe</p>
                                <p><b>Nickname(s):</b> Chlo-chlo, Baby Chlo</p>
                                <p><b>Likes:</b> Kibble, laser pointers, feather toys, butt pets, us</p>

                                <br>
                                <p>Chloe is the youngest of the family. She's timid and doesn't like it when her environment changes. When we first got her, it took her months before she warmed up to us. Nowadays, Chloe is the sweetest of the bunch (actually all of them are sweet). She loves cuddling up to my husband especially when we're playing video games. Most mornings when we open the bedroom door, she's the first one to rush into the room and greet us.</p>
                                <p>But despite her sweetness, Chloe is still a cat and does cat things such as knocking things over and biting things she shouldn't when she gets super into the pets. At night, she also goes crazy and likes to run around and meow for no reason. Even so, Chloe is loved and cherished by the both of us.</p>

                                <p><b>Name:</b> Krazy</p>
                                <p><b>Nickname(s):</b> Kray-kray, Baby Kray</p>
                                <p><b>Likes:</b> Her humans, all types of toys, belly rubs, us</p>
                                <p><b>Dislikes:</b> Being picked up for too long, being in enclosed spaces</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Krazy is the second youngest of the family and is bonded with Spaz. Like Chloe, it took her a bit to warm up to us. She only came out when we weren't in the garage. Oh, I didn't mention but they were originally barn cats which is why we kept them in the garage for the first few months. These days, Krazy happily greets us whenever she sees us. She also likes requesting for belly rubs. She does this by lying down by our feet and showing her belly to us. Of course we grant her those little pets.</p>
                                <p>Krazy is also unlike her name, she doesn't really go crazy or anything. We just didn't bother changing any of their names when we adopted them from Tri-County Humane Society. Krazy is sweet as well. She likes hanging out with me in my home office when I do homework, or just chill on the computer. She also likes to join me for naps. Krazy she loves being where the action is. If my husband and I are in the same room together, you bet Krazy will be there too.</p>

                                <p><b>Name:</b> Sal</p>
                                <p><b>Nickname(s):</b> Salvador, Salva-dorable, Mr. Adorable</p>
                                <p><b>Likes:</b> Kibble, wet food, laser pointers, us, wreacking havoc</p>
                                <p><b>Dislikes:</b> Getting pets on his butt or stomach</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Sal is the oldest of the group. When we first got him, he wasn't hiding like the other cats. Well, he was hiding but not in deep hiding where we couldn't find him. In fact I was able to pick him up within the first few days of getting him. Sal was the sweetest boy (not so sweet anymore but still a good boy) when we first got him. He was also the worst off physically out of the bunch. He had a broken leg, sinus infection, and frost bite. But despite all of that, Sal treated us nicely and only wanted love.</p>
                                <p>Now that Sal's been nursed back to health, he can be a bit mean. Sometimes when we pet him he bunny kicks us, but that's ok he's just a little cat doing little cat things. Inspite of not liking pets for too long and in certain areas, Sal LOVES attention. He hates it when I'm doing something else and not paying attention to him. When I'm on my computer, he loves walking in front of the screen and hopping on top of my PC.</p>

                                <p><b>Nickname(s):</b> Spazie, Baby Spaz</p>
                                <p><b>Likes:</b> Napping, laser pointers, plushies, us, tomenting Chloe</p>
                                <p><b>Dislikes:</b> Chloe, being picked up</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>Spazie is the second oldest of the group. When we first got her, she wasn't too resistant when it came to us. It took her a while to warm up to us as well. But these days there are times when she naps with us. She still doesn't like getting picked up. I still try to though to teach her nothing bad will happen.</p>
                                <p>Spazie is pretty docile. She just likes napping in different places around the house. Occassionally she will play with her many plushies that is scattered in the living room. But sometimes, she likes to chase Chloe around for some unknown reason and Chloe doesn't like it. But there are times when those two get along. Last Christmas, we had all 4 cats napping on the couch together!</p>
